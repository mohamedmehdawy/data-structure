main idea:
the tree will be perfect if the all levels is full
so i need to:
-- each subtree has left and right, and if left is leaf the right should be leaf
-- left side and right side should have the same level

is_perfect(root, level=0): this function check if the tree is perfect or not
#
if no root, return [true, level]

check is perfect for left side = is_perfect(root.left, level+ 1)
if check for left is false, return [false, level]
check is perfect for right side = is_perfect(root.left, level+ 1)

if left and right have same level, return [true, left level (left and right have same level)]
return [false, max of (left and right level)]
#
