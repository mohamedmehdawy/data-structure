try to simulate call stack of functions like recursion but using iterative way with stack

inorder_iterative() => this function print the tree inorder using iterative way
main idea if i show the node just 1 this mean i should call the left, and if show is 2 mean i should call the right
and if show is 3 this mean i handle left and right and should remove current node from the stack
#
create stack and init it with root and show number will be 0

while (loop if stack is not empty):
##
current_node_data = will be the last one in the stack

if current_node_data is None, pop from the stack and continue
if the current node not have left and right: print it and remove from the stack (using pop) and go to the next iteration
increase show by 1

if the current_node[1] is 1: append the left of current node to the stack
if the current_node[1] is 2: print firs the current node (because we need to print (left - current - right)) append the right of current node to the stack 
else: remove from the stack (using pop)
##
after end print new line
