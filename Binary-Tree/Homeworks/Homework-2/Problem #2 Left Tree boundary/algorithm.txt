_longest_line(root, height) => this function return the longest line list starts from root
#
if no root return none, false
if not root.left and not root.right: if the height = 0, return [root], true
left_data, left_status = call longest_line for the left and will return with data and status and pass height -1
if left_status is true, append current node to the left data and return it with true
right_data, right_status = call longest_line for the right and will return with data and status and pass height -1
if right_status is true, append current node to the right data and return it with true

if arraive to here, return none, false

traverse_left_boundry () => this function return the longest line in the left of root
$$
main idea need to know the height the left of the main root, and try to arraive to the node = this height,
when i arraive to it, add this node to the result and return true, to make the line untile arraive to the main root
$$

#
get height of tree = the function return the height of the node
get longest_line = longest_line(left of the root, with height - 1 (because we will start from the left of root not the current root))
append main root to longest_line
return longest_line
