Diameter of Binary Tree
$
the main idea is get the longest node in left and right and calc the length between them
$
_tree_height(root) => this function return the height of the tree stated from the target node
diameterOfBinaryTree() => this function return the diameter of a binary tree
#
'get left and right height and increase each 1 by 1, because we start from the children not from the root'
get left height left_height = _tree_height(left of root) + 1 
get right height right_height = _tree_height(right of root) + 1 
return the sum of left and right height
