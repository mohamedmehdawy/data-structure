Diameter of Binary Tree
$
the main idea is get the longest node in left and right and calc the length between them
i need to get the longest for each root node and return the max path
$
_tree_height(root) => this function return the height of the tree stated from the target node
_diameterOfBinaryTree(root) => this function return the diameter of a binary tree
#
if not root, return None
'get left and right height and increase each 1 by 1, because we start from the children not from the root'
get left height left_height = _tree_height(left of root) + 1 
get right height right_height = _tree_height(right of root) + 1 
return the sum of left and right height
#
diameterOfBinaryTree(root) => 
#
if no root, return none
'this to walk in the last node and work in reverse'
get left node = diameterOfBinaryTree(left of root)
get right node =  diameterOfBinaryTree(right of root)
return the max of diameter of left and right and root (in this order)
