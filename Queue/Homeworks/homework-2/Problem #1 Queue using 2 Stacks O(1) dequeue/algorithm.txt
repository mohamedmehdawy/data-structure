queue
properties:
- stk1: the first stack
- skt2: the second stack

methods:
- move(stk1, stk2): move the elements from stack to another using pop to clear each element you move
#
if stk1 is empty return no thing
loop until skt1 be empty, each time pop the elements from 1 and push to 2
#

- enqeue(value): add the value to the queue
#
if first stack have no elements just append to first one
first move elements from skt1 to stk2 (reverse the stk1)
add the value to stk2
move elements from stk2 to stk1
#

- deqeue: remove the first element in the qeueue (will be the top of stk1)
#
pop the stk1
#

- is_empty: return the boolean value of queue is empty or not
#
return the status value of is_empty function from stk1
