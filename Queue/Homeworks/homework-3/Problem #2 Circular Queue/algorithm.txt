Queue Class => this class handle the queue operations
proerties:
- front, rear => will start with the index of 0
- array => the array will store the elements
- size => the size of the array

methods:
- _next(pos) => this function return the next of the position passed
#
- increase the pos
- if the pos is equal the size, reutrn 0, else return the position
#
- enque(value) => this function add the value to the array if it not full
#
- if the array is full, tell the user
- else, add the value to the current rear
-- get the next pos for the rear and set it
#
- deque => this function remove the front element and move the front 1 step, until it will be empty 
#
- if the array is empty, tell the user
- else, set the current front = None
-- get the next pos for the front and set it
#
- isFull => this function check if the queue is full or not
#
- retrun true if the the front and rear are the same, and the current value of both is not None
#
- isEmpty => this function check if the queue is empty or not
#
- retrun true if the the front and rear are the same, and the current value of both is None
#

- repr => this function print the queue
#
if the queue is empty return empty string
set result empty list
set current = the front
set counter = None and check
- if queue is full, set counter = queue length
- elif rear is greater than the front, set counter = rear - front
- else, set counter = the length - (front - rear)

loop insted of counter:
    append current to the result
    move the current to the next one
convert the list to string and return is
