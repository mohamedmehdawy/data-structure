build the queue using 2 stacks, the idea here:
- when take the element from stack to another you reverse the first one and this will be
look like the queue logical idea
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
queue
properties:
- stk1: the first stack
- skt2: the second stack

methods:
- move(stk1, stk2): move the elements from stack to another using pop to clear each element you move
#
if stk1 is empty return no thing
loop until skt1 be empty, each time pop the elements from 1 and push to 2
#

- enqeue(value): add the value to the queue
#
just append the value to stk1
#

- deqeue: remove the first element in the qeueue (will be the top of stk1)
$$
idea here we want to remove the first element in the stack not the pop, so we need to reverse it first
but we will save the reversed in stk2, and if we need to remove the first element,
just pop the stk2
$$
#
if the stk2 is empty, move elements from stk1
save removed element from skt2, in value
return value
#

- is_empty: return the boolean value of queue is empty or not
#
return the status value of is_empty function from stk1
#

- __repr__: for print the object
$$
idea here we need to reverse the stk1
$$
#
set result_stk2 it will be the same with out change
set result_stk1 list and it will be list convert from string using split
merge two results and set it in result, but put the ', ' between skt2 and stk1 if the two elements have values
return the result
