build the queue using 2 stacks, the idea here:
- when take the element from stack to another you reverse the first one and this will be
look like the queue logical idea
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
queue
properties:
- stk1: the first stack
- skt2: the second stack

methods:
- move(stk1, stk2): move the elements from stack to another using pop to clear each element you move
#
if stk1 is empty return no thing
loop until skt1 be empty, each time pop the elements from 1 and push to 2
#

- enqeue(value): add the value to the queue
#
just append the value to stk1
#

- deqeue: remove the first element in the qeueue (will be the top of stk1)
$$
idea here we want to remove the first element in the stack not the pop, so we need to reverse it first
$$
#
if empty, return no thing
move elements from stk1 to stk2
pop the top element in stk2 and store it in removed element variable
move elements from stk2 to stk1
#

- is_empty: return the boolean value of queue is empty or not
#
return the status value of is_empty function from stk1
#

- __repr__: for print the object
$$
idea here we need to reverse the stk1
$$
#
set result list and it will be list convert from string using split
return the reversed of the result
